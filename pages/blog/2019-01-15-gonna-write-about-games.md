But so far, a little introduction. I will risk a thesis - Playing is a beautiful profession. However, it requires awareness, a great deal of work and - more than once - maturity, going beyond knocking on the keyboard. 

My mission is to help you in your development but only by the way.I really help myself.I have a desire to encourage you to various activities.

I very much encourage you to share with me comments, observations, remarks. I am here for you.  I read everything, reply to everything. I want the goal of all players to be simply enjoying life...
