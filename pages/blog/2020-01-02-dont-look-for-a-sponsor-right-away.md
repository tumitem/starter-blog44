Before you decide to go for money to investors for new equipment, a new mouse and a new keyboard for players, you have to think carefully about whether this is the right time. Think about your further vision and strategy for developing yourself as a player and whether you really want to let the investor into your virtual game world and compete for money with the best. 

Above all, however, you need to think about why you have decided to do this at all. Yes, most of us (players) don't have any money of our own and they would definitely need a cash injection. Sometimes I even have the impression that for some people, winning an investor becomes an end in itself. However, you have to remember about the long-term consequences. First of all, you will divorce your life The sooner you let other people in or enter the gaming huse, the less work you give yourself.

Secondly, you get an accomplice who is not emotionally attached to your passion. This is neither his passion nor the work on which his life and well-being depend. Remember, for him, a company is just one of many portfolio companies. And for you a huge part of your life and not only your personal finances may depend on it.
