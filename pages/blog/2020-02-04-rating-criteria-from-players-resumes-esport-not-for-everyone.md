We assess their importance by giving them weight; we also give weight to the answers to recruitment questions proposed in of the previous part. If, when recruiting for a given position, the most important thing for us is experience, should be given the highest rank (e.g. Multiplier 3). If we consider the answers to questions to be more important than experience, the multiplier should be adjusted accordingly. The question depends on the level of advancement of the game and knowledge of the game. For example, the league of legends changes on average every month with a new patch. We require knowledge of these changes!

Based on our experience with companies we have worked with, we strongly recommend concentration and prioritisation of the experience and behavioural part in of the candidates. Riot games and Valve always carefully select the people they intend to work with.

Many times we have seen how much more important in practice are practical knowledge in the field of work and attitude and approach to the work itself, together with the already mentioned characteristics, which are crucial for remote workers.
To systematize the assessment, a table with assessment criteria can be created for each question. This will facilitate the allocation of points and bring candidates closer to an objective comparison. It will also make it easier to share the assessment of applications with other people in the team. In general, life and a good attitude in Gaming House unifies the player and increases the credibility as well as the way a player is evaluated.
