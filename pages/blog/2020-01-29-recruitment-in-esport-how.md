## practical tips:

A job advertisement for a remote job, i.e. playing, streaming, is no different from a standard job advertisement. To gather all the information in one place, below is a proposed list of basic sections in such an advertisement

* Briefly about the gaming company 
* Terms of reference 
* Benefits, advantages besides ..playing) 
* required/preferred competences and skills 

In addition, a minimum one-course description of a typical working day should be included: it will enable candidates to understand better whether this is something for them (for example: You will start at 11 a.m. and finish at 7 p.m., but it will be up to you to decide where you want to go and with what tools. 

### Determine the scale of remote working and its conditions.

Are there any hours? Is it supposed to be just 8 hours of work, but done in any way? Or maybe not the hours are important, but the final effect? It's worth to be more precise.

The section "it's NOT a job for you if": an interesting section that has a powerful deterrent effect on candidates who are not really suitable for such a job, and at the same time encourages those who may find themselves well in it. For example: "This is NOT a job for you if you are looking for a remote job to pretend that you are working" 

Transparency of remuneration: the placement of a fork in the advertisement is to be considered. This narrows the circle of applicants and discourages those who would like to work as a commentary to the ESL leagues for example 

All novice players are asked to send a few sentences of answers to the following intriguing questions. 

* Example 30 minutes before the planned daily meeting and training with the team you don't have a working computer and you are far from home. What are you doing? Describe briefly what you will do in this situation. (proactivity check) 
* You've had a lot of visitors recently and you've noticed that you're starting to get lost. Describe briefly how you will get out of this situation (work organization)

### It is worth considering whether or not to title the ad with a clear information that it is about remote work, i.e. playing or not (e.g. party columns, interviews, etc.). Both options have their pros and cons

I leave the decision on how to resolve this issue to each recruiter individually, as it depends to a large extent on the priorities of a given organization in terms of both image and esports
