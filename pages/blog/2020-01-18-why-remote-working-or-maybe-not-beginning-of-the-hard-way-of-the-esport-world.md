## What do you think we'll take into account to stay on our own? 



No matter what you do. Generally, you can be a freelancer in everything Not everyone is interested in working remotely, and not everyone will find themselves well in this mode of work. 

You can risk saying that this is quite a narrow group of people: open, conscious, rather proficient in technology, often ambitious, mostly from the so-called Millenniumals generation. In the recruitment for positions in the traditional model of work we deal with a whole spectrum of human personality types.

Numerous positions or industries to which it has become a certain standard to recruit employees to work at least partly remotely is: IT (programming), customer service by phone/e-mail, design, streaming, broadcasting, playing games, making money on gaming, copywriting, translations, project manager, selling practically everything and gaining customers via the Internet. 

> I focus mainly on the entertainment industry. 

They are largely based on independent work, so it doesn't matter if someone does their duties, which are often friendly, at home or in the office. There are, however, many positions for which remote working does not have to be a beneficial solution, or even impossible. 

Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to work remotely or partially remotely. Fortunately, it is possible to precisely identify a few key competences that increase a person's chances of working outside the office. So in this sense, remote working is a bit more challenging. It's not like turning on the computer, turning on the webcam and doing everything by itself. It's not like being good at the game. 



## You can even be very good, but it's just the beginning of the hard way of the esport world
