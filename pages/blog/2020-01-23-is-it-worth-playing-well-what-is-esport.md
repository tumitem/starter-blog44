I have been running the players' website and tournaments since March 2014 and since then I have constantly heard some statements and questions: 

## ***Is it worth playing ?*** ***I don't have time to stream. I don't have parents who like it.***

The best: Games won't give you a future. Sometimes there is also the question of what right I have to talk about escort, when I don't actually play, but just compile and watch.

That's right. You don't have to play Counter Strike or League of Legends. Just watch it. And you'll know how to start. I'd recommend that my friend at the editorial office of our journal write about the steps you need to take to **[start your career in esports](https://esporttalk.org/t/how-to-start-streaming-esport/510)**  Personally, I think that everyone should be interested in this field, no matter what their education or hobby.

If someone doesn't understand the e-world now, it will only be more difficult later. It doesn't matter if the esport stays in this form or not. Everything is changing but it is worth keeping up with the changes.

Unfortunately, I've had to deal more than once with people earning 6-digit amounts every month, who have fallen into a spiral of playing and gambling addiction. Playing for the sake of playing without any purpose and without any sense. It's just a waste of time, not a good use of it

They couldn't or didn't want to limit the time to play by themselves. And I think the very fact that I'm in a much better position than them and the fact that we earned it with my team from the old semi-professional team in CS:GO

I think that's enough "mandate" to share my experience. 

## **It's not always worth playing and streaming.** If you don't feel it. Don't do it. But watch.

###### Watch how the world is changing. Cosplayers are only a fraction of what's around the esport. That's why I'm promoting **wise playing and wise streaming** on my blog. Wise, that is, one in which we try to reduce unnecessary costs of our time while increasing the effects.

The point is that there is no single instruction for player's success. Each of us is different, has different preferences, different level of expectations from life, different priorities. That is why it is worthwhile to individually adjust every aspect of our life to each other. 

I also recommend that you don't focus solely on sport. In my opinion the best development strategy is ... continuous learning. Continuous change. And eternal questioning of what someone...writes.
